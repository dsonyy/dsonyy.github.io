# Hello!

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/avatar.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Szymon Bednorz" class="avatar">

I'm Szymon, a 23 yo founder and doer.

**I love to work on the intersection of space, software and hardware.**

I believe contributions to space technology are among the most exciting and impactful things we can work on.
As a co-founder of [CleverHive Space](https://cleverhive.space/), I build mission control software for the next generation of lunar rover missions. 
Previously, I led the development of rover prototypes at [AGH Space Systems](https://www.linkedin.com/company/agh-space-systems), serving as a team leader and software engineer.

I'm always seeking new paths to grow in the chaos (sometimes getting lost). This blog is a space to document and plan my journey by sharing my thoughts and things I build.
