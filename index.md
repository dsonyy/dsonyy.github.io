Yo, I'm Szymon, 23.

Co-founder of [CleverHive Space](https://cleverhive.space/), where we build software to coordinate lunar rover missions.

Before that, I led [AGH Space Systems](https://www.linkedin.com/company/agh-space-systems) to 1st place at URC 2024 - the world's biggest space robotics competition. We also won top prizes in Australia, Canada, India, and across Europe.

I'm a Software Engineer and recent CS graduate, working at the intersection of space, software, and hardware.

This blog is where I share my journey - projects, thoughts, and ideas.
