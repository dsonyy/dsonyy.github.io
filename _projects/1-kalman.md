description:
  - I spent 2 years as a software engineer on the Kalman planetary rover, working on autonomy and operations. 
  - I competed in IRC 2023 (1st place, India), URC 2023 (8th place, USA), and ERC 2022 & 2023 (2x 1st place, Europe). 
  - In 2024, I led the team to 1st place globally at URC and 2nd at ERC. 
  - I wrapped up my journey as an advisor at ARCh 2025 (Australia) - ending with another 1st place.
