description: In a team building planetary rovers (AGH Space Systems), I focused on autonomous navigation and obstacle detection. We design and build Mars rover prototypes and compete in international robotics competitions that simulate real exploration missions. The project combines electronics, software, and science - all working together to create a robot capable of analyzing soil, and operating autonomously in unknown terrain.<br/><br/><em>S. Bednorz, M. Olszewski, M. Łagan, M. Gibiec, Kalman rover - electronics, software and science, Zeszyty STN, no. 38, pp. 156–164, 2022. Presented at the 59th AGH Student Research Conference, Kraków, Poland.</em>
